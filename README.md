# PureScript Google AppScript

PureScript bindings for Google AppScript Services, such as Google Sheets, Google Docs, etc.

## Change log
**0.2.0**
1. Breaking changes: restructured the name space to approximate Google Workspace Services and Script Services name spaces, such as `Base`, `Spreadsheet`, `Document`, and `Forms`.  For example, the previous module name space `Google.AppsScript.SpreadsheetApp`  became `Google.AppsScript.Sheets.SpreadSheetApp`. See [Google Apps Script Reference](https://developers.google.com/apps-script/reference) for more information.
2. Methods are now fully documented based on their Google Apps Script documentation pages.
3. Added numerous methods to `Base`, `Spreadsheet`, `Sheet`, `Range` and `Spreadsheet App`

## TODO
1. Add tests using dummy spreadsheet
2.
