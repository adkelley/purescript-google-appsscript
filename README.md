# PureScript Google AppScript

PureScript bindings for Google AppScript Services, such as Google Sheets, Google Docs, etc.

## Change log
**0.2.0** - Breaking change: restructured the name space to approximate Google Workspace Services name space, such as `Spreadsheet`, `Document`, `Forms`.  For example, the previous module name space `Google.AppsScript.SpreadsheetApp`  became `Google.AppsScript.Sheets.SpreadSheetApp`. See [Google Apps Script Reference](https://developers.google.com/apps-script/reference) for more information.

## TODO
1. Add tests using dummy spreadsheet
2.
